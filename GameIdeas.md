# Game Ideas

## Survival game 
- post apocalyptic earth
- double oxygen
- massive plants and insects
- realistic graphics

## first person, low poly, rpg, coop dungeon crawler/or open world. Multiple classes, but they are not linked to anything (could work with darkrealm)
- idea1: to revive a teammate you need to manually draw something on the ground. the more you know about the drawing (first is a star, second is a star with 3 simbols, etc...), the better the revive
- no handholding
- rpg elements (people slowly build up a character)
	example: book1 is a generic magic book, read it, you can cast a firebolt
		book2 is harder to read, only those, who learnt book1 can learn it
		... slowly becomes a better magician
	
	example2: if you use a sword a lot (like skyrim), you will become better and better at that specific weapon

- to battle with everyone knowing everything, there should be a system, where a float percentage would decide, how much improvement would something be
	example1: if you only learn fire spells -> that float will stay at 1.00
		if you learn spells and archery -> float will go down to like 0.80 (can go till .5 maybe..)
		every time a different category is learnt the float goes down
		=> every time you learn something, the damage/or potency of said talent will be * by this float
	- so if you want to be the best at something, you should focus on only that
	- if you want to be prepared for anything, then you cant be the strongest

	
## pvp/br 
- idea: 3rd person shooter/fighting game
- u get some material
- you can draw a 2D image with the amount of material you have
- an AI will look at that 2D image and give you a corresponding item
  	- exaple: you draw a bottle with red liquid inside -> you get a health potion




## 2D pixelated hack/slash type game
- game engine: Godot
- graphics possibilities:
	1. stylized 2d
		- player character 40 fps, everything else is 24
  		- high quality lighting and effects (possibly ray-traced)
  		- real time effects/cutscenes (if the character is in cold area -> you can see breath, its not just an animation for every scenario)
  	   
- idea:
	- open world connected by hidden passage ways (2d but you can go to a different zone "behind" the current one...)
 	- player has lvls
 	- active weapon => fire based weapons categorized by weight
  		- example: heavy hammer (slow, big dmg, fire spread dmg); dagger (fast, small damage, applies burn); ...
    	- passive weapon => trinkets that you find can be equipped (only a few), they have bonuses
      		- example: burn the ground behind you; a fire ball flies towards the enemy; attackers get damaged when hitting you; ... 		 


 - story:
 	- starts with tutorial-> after it player learns the true meaning behind his existance
	- player is a soldier fighting for some mythical warlord who wants to burn the world down
 	- player awakens, runs away
  	- player feels like the warlord cant be defeted
   	- player starts the game...
   	- player explores, gets xp, gets stronger, meet strangers, do sidequests
   	- has to keep going (still running away)
   	- near the end of the game he realises he has to do something (he is strong enough now)
   	- player has to go through all the zones before
   	- player enteres tutorial area
   	- at the end the warlord sends his army at the player->player defeates the mindless army
   	- player defeats the warlord
  	   
 - extra idea_1:
   	- player can move, jump, melee hit(stamina), range hit(mana), dodge(a set amount)
   	- every time the player attacks, a random weapon will be chosen
   	- example: player jumps, (currently equipped weapon is fireball), range attack, (game now automatically equips hammer), player dodges closer, melee hit, (game changes weapon again)
   	- this could be an extra mode
   	  
 - extra idea_2:
 	- online pvp arena
  	- player cape has different colours

## Horror game idea 2022. Nov
Ideas to the game itself:
- UE5
- 3D
- Character has item, can only use 1 at a time, flashlight when dark, cross when chased, but then its dark---
- Not a lot of jumpscares
- Mostly make the sound and setting creepy
- Mystery around the enemy/monster
- Game has a backstory hidden
- Makes the player think about it=theories
- Puzzles with multiple possible endings
 (you find things->make a weapon->break window or you find a casette tape->record noises->make the monster break the window)
Location
- Find an actual location and model it in game (abandoned house blueprint or something ..etc)
- Maybe tudoszuro egerben
- Or something similar
- Run down apartment
- Place should be big, but easy to understand

Enemy
- Humanoid, but disturbing
- Features are off
- Sound is off
- Movement is off
- Human like
- Only one, with hints of multiple

Player
- First person
- Attached to the place in some way
- No voice acting, maybe little noises for immersion

Setting
- Dusty, old, rundown place
- Modern day/or 50s
 
Story
- Starts with main character entering house
- brief showcase of 2 missing people (seems to be unrelated)
- Has to find something (journal of some famous killer)
- it is in his old mansion
- Enters house with minor equipment (flashlight with 1 battery, house’s blueprint (no hud on the map/no help))
- player ends up finding the 2 missing people in the tools shack (this is a secret) ,seems to be a suicide, but they leave a note saying they cant leave (paranoid text...))
- the killer comes back as a ghost (maybe with other victims come back as ghosts as well, but they are harmless and disturbing)

# Program idea

## ablakos alkalmazás sorozatok lejátszására
- megnyitod az alkalmazást
- megadod neki a fájlokat (vagy egyesével, vagy egy mappát)
- megnyitja a fájlt vlc-ben
- készít egy txt vagy valamilyen fájlt, ahol az előző epizódot tárolja (pl ha végignéztél 3 részt, akkor a fájlt azt fogja mutatni hogy megnéztél 3 részt, és a negyedikkel fog kezdeni)
- vlc automatikusan eltárolja hol jártál a részen belül
- ha bezársz hamarabb egy fájlt, mint hogy végetérne, lesz egy boolean (have fully watched), amit true-ra állíthatsz, hogy a txt-ben eltárolja, hogy végignézted (így az end credits-et nem kell végigpörgetni, hogy a program tudja, hogy végetért a rész)
- nagy gombokkal lehetne a következőt megnyitni, vagy az előzőt
