# Game Ideas

## Survival game 
- post apocalyptic earth
- double oxygen
- massive plants and insects
- realistic graphics

## first person, low poly, rpg, coop dungeon crawler/or open world. Multiple classes, but they are not linked to anything (could work with darkrealm)
- idea1: to revive a teammate you need to manually draw something on the ground. the more you know about the drawing (first is a star, second is a star with 3 simbols, etc...), the better the revive
- no handholding
- rpg elements (people slowly build up a character)
	example: book1 is a generic magic book, read it, you can cast a firebolt
		book2 is harder to read, only those, who learnt book1 can learn it
		... slowly becomes a better magician
	
	example2: if you use a sword a lot (like skyrim), you will become better and better at that specific weapon

- to battle with everyone knowing everything, there should be a system, where a float percentage would decide, how much improvement would something be
	example1: if you only learn fire spells -> that float will stay at 1.00
		if you learn spells and archery -> float will go down to like 0.80 (can go till .5 maybe..)
		every time a different category is learnt the float goes down
		=> every time you learn something, the damage/or potency of said talent will be * by this float
	- so if you want to be the best at something, you should focus on only that
	- if you want to be prepared for anything, then you cant be the strongest

	
## pvp/br 
- idea: 3rd person shooter/fighting game
- u get some material
- you can draw a 2D image with the amount of material you have
- an AI will look at that 2D image and give you a corresponding item
  	- exaple: you draw a bottle with red liquid inside -> you get a health potion
